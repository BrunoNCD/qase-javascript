> # Qase TMS Cypress reporter
>
> Publish results simple and easy.

## How to integrate

```
npm install cypress-qase-reporter
```

## Example of usage

If you want to decorate come test with Qase Case ID you could use qase function:

```typescript
import { qase } from "cypress-qase-reporter/dist/mocha";

describe("My First Test", () => {
  qase(
    [1, 2],
    it("Several ids", () => {
      expect(true).to.equal(true);
    })
  );
  qase(
    3,
    it("Correct test", () => {
      expect(true).to.equal(true);
    })
  );
  qase(
    4,
    it.skip("Skipped test", () => {
      expect(true).to.equal(true);
    })
  );
  qase(
    5,
    it("Failed test", () => {
      expect(true).to.equal(false);
    })
  );
});
```

You should also have an active item in the project settings at

```
https://app.qase.io/project/QASE_PROJECT_CODE/settings/options
```

option in the `Test Runs` block:

```
Allow submitting results in bulk
```

If you are going to use several specifications for execution and you have in config

```bash
"runComplete": true
```

then it is necessary to additionally set in the project settings

```
Allow to add results for cases in closed runs.
```

To run tests and create a test run, execute the command (for example from folder examples):

```bash
QASE_REPORT=1 npx cypress run
```

or

```bash
npm test
```

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Run project in dev watch mode
   ```sh
   npm run dev:watch
   ```
3. Make any needed changes to `./src/index.ts`
4. There is also the option to test with the example project, go to examples
   ```sh
   cd examples
   ```
5. Install examples dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
6. Update config file with API key and project code `./examples/[cypress-v6|cypress-v10]`
7. Run example test
   ```sh
   npm run test
   ```
